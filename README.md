# Data Structures Practice Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures Practice Repository! This repository serves as a record of my journey in learning and practicing various data structures concepts and implementations. Below, you'll find a list of the data structures I've explored along with brief descriptions and links to the corresponding code and resources. Feel free to explore and learn from my progress.

## Introduction

In this repository, I've documented my practice and exploration of different data structures. I believe that understanding data structures is crucial for efficient problem-solving and software development. This repository serves as a valuable resource for others interested in learning about data structures and their implementations.

## Data Structures Covered

1. **Linked Lists:** Understanding singly linked lists and their operations.
 	- [Singly Linked List](/linked_list)

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a structured format:

- Each data structure has its own dedicated folder.
- Inside each folder, you'll find code implementations and relevant resources.
